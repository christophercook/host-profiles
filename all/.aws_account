# If using Docker for aws-cli you can define an
# AWS account in this file for use by the aliases
# (defined in .bash_aliases). You must also ensure
# that the account credentials (access id and
# secret key) are stored in your keyring.

# In Ubuntu key ids and secrets can be added to the
# keyring with the secret-tool

# secret-tool store --label='AWS ACCESS KEY ID for iam_user @ aws_account' \
#   type 'AWS ACCESS KEY ID' account iam_user
# secret-tool store --label='AWS SECRET ACCESS KEY for iam_user @ aws_account' \
#   type 'AWS SECRET ACCESS KEY' account iam_user


#export AWS_ACCOUNT=foo
#export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
